## Getting set up
To get your python environment set up, you can create a virtual environment and use the requirements.txt file to install the proper versions of various libraries.
```bash
 #or you can follow these steps
 $ source venv/bin/activate
 $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 
 #add hostname and database credentials
```

## TODO

- Show MetaData with the Shorten URL.
- To make it compatible with multiple app servers (Adding load balancer, zookeeper etc.)
